I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS!!!!! This is for people with plug pocketmine, since they can't download and install plugins and can only install reviewed plugins on poggit. That's why i'm doing this, because the original rankup plugin is not being reviewed for some reason.

RankUp
========
RankUp is a comically full-featured prison ranking plugin. It allows players upgrade their ranking using a certain amount of money. To manage ranks, RankUp comes with a built in group manager called DoesGroups. You can also use PurePerms to manage ranks. RankUp comes with support for both EconomyS and PocketMoney for a currency.

## Permissions
